Extensions for the Oboo clock

These are very much experimental, use at your own risk

## World Clock Card
This is a world clock card, loosely based on the weather card.
It presents two more timezones, configured manually in /etc/config.json

Copy the worldclock.js file to /usr/bin/js/
Examine the config.json file and update your /etc/contrib.json accordingly
